    "To create scalable data extraction workflows, Indexical allows you to construct a pipeline of high-level steps that describe how to go from a URL / query to clean, structured data. Each step contains an `action` that is tied to a task-specific agent on our end, as well as a natural language `goal` to instruct the agent. We'll start by importing the `crawl_site.json` file as our pipeline and printing it below. \n",
    "\n",
    "This pipeline will crawl through the first `10` URLs on each website, and download the main content of the webpage. You can adjust the number of pages scraped or remove the limit entirely. By default, Indexical will crawl through all of the pages in the domain. If you would like to only crawl through a subset of the pages, you can input a regex in `pattern`, and Indexical will only open links that match that pattern. \n"

Your\\nrights and obligations with respect to certain Services will be based in part on\\nthe pricing plan you\\u00a0choose.\\n\\n5.2. Payment Terms.\\n\\n5.2.1. Subscriptions. When you purchase our Services (each such purchase, a\\n\\u201cSubscription\\u201d), you expressly authorize us or our third-party payment processor\\nto charge you for such Services. For the avoidance of doubt, Subscriptions do\\nnot include any sales by third parties on Figma Community; such sales are\\ncovered by Section 5.2.2.,\\u00a0below.\\n\\n5.2.2. Community Purchases. If you purchase any Community Resources on Figma\\nCommunity, you acknowledge and agree that Figma is acting as the Community\\nCreator\\u2019s disclosed commercial agent for the sale, so you are required to make\\nany payments directly to us and you expressly authorize us or our third-party\\npayment processor to charge you for such Community Resources. The applicable\\nfees, including any recurring fees, for Community Resources are specified during\\nthe payment process.\\n\\n5.2.3. You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all\\npayment methods that you provide\\u00a0to\\u00a0us.\\n\\n5.2.4. All fees are stated and solely payable in U.S. Dollars (unless otherwise\\nstated during the payment process), non-cancelable, non-refundable (except as\\notherwise expressly set forth in these Terms), and not subject to\\u00a0setoff.\\n\\n5.2.5. In the event that you fail to pay the full amount owed to us, we may\\nlimit your access to the Services, in addition to any other rights or remedies\\nwe\\u00a0may\\u00a0have.\\n\\n5.3. Authorization for Recurring Payments.\\n\\n5.3.1. All Subscription pricing plans involve recurring fees (each, along with\\nany applicable taxes and other charges are a \\u201cSubscription Fee\\u201d). Depending on\\nwhich options you choose, those fees may recur each month, quarter or year\\nthereafter, at the then-current rate. Please note that our fees are subject to\\nchange, although we will notify you before we effect any\\u00a0change.\\n\\n5.3.2. By agreeing to these Terms and purchasing a Subscription, you acknowledge\\nthat your Subscription has recurring payment features and you accept\\nresponsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to cancellation of\\nyour Subscription by you or Figma. We (or our third party payment processor)\\nwill automatically charge you in accordance with the term of your Subscription\\n(e.g., each month, quarter, or year), on the calendar day corresponding to the\\ncommencement of your Subscription using the payment information you\\nhave\\u00a0provided.\\n\\n5.3.3. In the event your Subscription begins on a day not contained in a later\\nmonth, your payment method will be charged on such other day as we deem\\nappropriate. For example, if you started a monthly Subscription on January 31st,\\nyour next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your payment method\\nwould be billed on that date. We may also periodically authorize your payment\\nmethod in anticipation of applicable fees or related charges.\\n\\n5.3.4. Your Subscription continues until canceled by you or we terminate your\\naccess to or use of the Services or the Subscription in accordance with\\nthese\\u00a0Terms.\\n\\n5.4. CANCELING SUBSCRIPTIONS\\n\\n5.4.1. You may cancel your Subscription at any time but please note that such\\ncancellation will only be effective at the end of the then-current Subscription\\nperiod. Unless required by law, you will not receive a refund of any portion of\\nthe subscription fee paid for the then current subscription period at the time\\nof cancellation.\\n\\n5.4.2. To cancel, you can either (i) email us at support@figma.com\\n[support@figma.com] and follow any instructions, if any, we provide to you in\\nresponse to your cancellation request, or (ii) for some kinds of Subscriptions,\\ninitiate a cancellation through your Figma account settings within the Services.\\nYou will be responsible for all Subscription Fees incurred for the then-current\\nSubscription period. Canceling your Subscription will not terminate your Figma\\naccount. See Section 10 (Termination) below for information on terminating your\\nFigma\\u00a0account.\\n\\n5.5. Taxes. All fees do not include taxes, and you agree to: (a) pay all\\nsales/use, gross receipts, value-added, GST, personal property, or other tax\\n(including any interest and penalties) with respect to the transactions and\\npayments under these Terms, other than taxes based on our income, employees, or\\nreal property; and (b) be responsible for any filing of any information or tax\\nreturns with respect thereto. If we were required to collect a tax and did not\\ndo so at the time of sale, we reserve the right to later charge you for the\\napplicable\\u00a0tax.\\n\\n5.6. Withholding. All payments made by you to us under these Terms exclude any\\ndeduction or withholding. If any such deduction or withholding (including but\\nnot limited to cross-border withholding taxes) is required by law, you will pay\\nsuch additional amounts as are necessary so that the net amount received by us\\nafter such deduction or withholding will be equal to the full amount that we\\nwould have received if no deduction or withholding had been required. Each party\\nwill use commercially reasonable efforts to work with the other party to help\\nobtain, reduce, or eliminate any necessary withholding, deduction, or royalty\\ntax exemptions where applicable.\\n\\n6. CONFIDENTIALITY.\\n\\n6.1. Confidential Information. We (the \\u201cDiscloser\\u201d) have disclosed or may\\ndisclose proprietary or non-public business, technical, financial, or other\\ninformation (\\u201cConfidential Information\\u201d) to you (the \\u201cRecipient\\u201d). Our\\nConfidential Information expressly includes non-public information regarding\\nfeatures, functionality, and performance of the Services, including security\\nrelated information.\\n\\n6.2. Obligations. The Recipient will use the Discloser\\u2019s Confidential\\nInformation only for the purpose of evaluating whether or not to use (or\\ncontinue to use) the Services. The Recipient will not disclose the Discloser\\u2019s\\nConfidential Information to parties other than the Recipient\\u2019s employees,\\ncontractors, affiliates, agents, or professional advisors (\\u201cRepresentatives\\u201d)\\nwho need to know it and who have a legal obligation to keep it confidential. The\\nRecipient will ensure that its Representatives are subject to no less\\nrestrictive confidentiality obligations than those herein. Notwithstanding the\\nforegoing, the Recipient may disclose the Discloser\\u2019s Confidential Information:\\n(a) if directed by Discloser; or (b) to the extent required by applicable legal\\nprocess, provided that the Recipient uses commercially reasonable efforts to (i)\\npromptly notify the Discloser in advance, to the extent permitted by law, and\\n(ii) comply with the Discloser\\u2019s reasonable requests regarding its efforts to\\noppose the disclosure. The obligations set forth herein will survive for so long\\nas these Terms are in effect between the parties and for five years thereafter.\\n\\n7. WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMERS.\\n\\n7.1. In the event of any loss or corruption of any data associated with a\\nSubscription, Figma will use commercially reasonable efforts to restore the lost\\nor corrupted data from the latest relevant backup maintained by Figma. EXCEPT\\nFOR THE FOREGOING, FIGMA WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS, DESTRUCTION,\\nALTERATION, UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR CORRUPTION OF\\u00a0ANY\\u00a0DATA.\\n\\n7.2.

EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY,\\nDISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS OF\\nTHESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS ALLOCATION IS REFLECTED IN THE PRICING\\nOFFERED BY FIGMA TO YOU AND IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN\\nBETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF\\nALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9 WILL\\nAPPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE\\nFAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN\\u00a0THESE\\u00a0TERMS.\\n\\n10. TERMINATION.\\n\\n10.1. We may terminate your access to and use of the Services, at our sole\\ndiscretion, at any time and without notice or liability to you, provided that if\\nFigma freezes your account or cancels your Subscription and the termination is\\nnot due to your breach of these Terms, Figma will provide you a pro rata refund\\nof pre-paid unused fees unless, in our reasonable estimation, we are not legally\\npermitted to do so (in which case any refund rights are null\\u00a0and\\u00a0void).\\n\\n10.2. You may cease use of the Services at any time. If you are paying for a\\nSubscription, you may terminate your Subscription through the process in Section\\n5.4. You may also cancel your Figma account at any time by sending an email to\\nsupport@figma.com [support@figma.com].\\n\\n10.3.

Figma AI Terms. The Figma AI Terms available at figma.com/legal/ai-terms/\\n[https://www.figma.com/legal/ai-terms/] outline additional terms and conditions\\nthat apply to your Customer Content, Figma artificial intelligence features, and\\nhow to control your AI-related settings. The Figma AI Terms form a part\\nof\\u00a0these\\u00a0Terms.\\n\\n11.3. Accessing Apps. The terms set forth on Exhibit A apply to any App accessed\\nthrough or downloaded from any app store or distribution platform (like the\\nApple App Store or Google Play) where the App may now or in the future be made\\navailable (each an \\\"App Provider\\\"). For the avoidance of doubt, Apps do not\\ninclude any Non-Figma Resources such as Community Resources.\\n\\n11.4. Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy (www.figma.com/privacy\\n[https://www.figma.com/privacy/]) governs how we collect, use and disclose\\ninformation from the\\u00a0Services.\\n\\n11.5. Copyright and IP Policy.

Force Majeure. Figma will not be liable for, or be considered to be in\\nbreach of or default under these Terms on account of, any delay or failure to\\nperform as required by these Terms as a result of any cause or condition beyond\\nits reasonable control, so long as it uses commercially reasonable efforts to\\navoid or remove those causes of non-performance.\\u00a0 If Figma believes in good\\nfaith that it is legally prohibited from providing you or your Authorized Users\\nwith the Services, we may freeze your account and/or cancel your subscription at\\nFigma\\u2019s sole discretion.\\n\\n11.9. Notices. Any notices or other communications provided by Figma under these\\nTerms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given by\\nFigma: (i) via e-mail; or (ii) by posting to the Site.

The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of\\nthese Terms will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other\\nprovision hereof and it is the intent and agreement of the parties that these\\nTerms will be deemed amended by modifying such provision to the extent necessary\\nto render it valid, legal, and enforceable while preserving its intent or, if\\nsuch modification is not possible, by substituting another provision that is\\nlegal and enforceable and that achieves the same\\u00a0objective.\\n\\n11.11. Groups. Certain features of the Services may allow you to participate in\\nteams, groups or organizations (each a \\u201cGroup\\u201d).

These Terms (and your access to any of the Services) are not\\nassignable or transferable by you without our prior written consent. Any\\npurported assignment in violation of this section is null\\u00a0and\\u00a0void.\\n\\n11.13. Service Providers.

No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is\\ncreated as a result of these Terms, and neither party has any authority of any\\nkind to bind the other party in any respect whatsoever.\\n\\n11.15. Governing Law. These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of\\nCalifornia without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The United Nations\\nConvention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically\\ndisclaimed.\\n\\n11.16. Dispute Resolution for\\u00a0Individuals\\n\\nYou and we both agree to resolve disputes related to your use of the Services or\\nthese Terms (each, a \\u201cClaim\\u201d) in binding arbitration instead of court, except\\nthat either party may bring suit in court to enjoin the infringement or other\\nmisuse of intellectual property rights.\\n\\nWhat is arbitration?\\n\\nArbitration does not involve a judge or jury. Instead, a neutral person (the\\n\\u201carbitrator\\u201d) hears each party\\u2019s side of the dispute and makes a decision that\\nis finally binding on both parties. The arbitrator can award the same relief as\\na court could, including monetary damages. While court review of an arbitration\\naward is limited, if a party fails to comply with the arbitrator\\u2019s decision,\\nthen the other party can have the arbitration decision enforced by\\u00a0a\\u00a0court.\\n\\nCan a Claim be part of a class action or similar proceeding?\\n\\nNO. YOU AGREE TO RESOLVE YOUR CLAIMS WITH US SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND\\nNOT AS PART OF A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION. WE AGREE TO DO\\nTHE SAME, WHETHER OR NOT YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION.
